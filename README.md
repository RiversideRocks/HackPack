HackPack
========
*"The best way to trick friends with hacks!"*
## What is HackPack?
HackPack is a starter kit to tricking your friends with "hacks" on the command line because
years of movies and TV from Hollywood have taught us that black screens with white text
mean **hackers!**

## Tutorials:
I have not fully documented how to use this, but I should soon.

To run the c part of this open up a linux terminal and move to the c folder.

`cd c`

Mark the file as executable.

`gcc hacks.c -o hacks`

Run the program.

`./hacks`
## Notes: 
In this tutorial I used (friend name)/index.php because I used the PHP to write notes that could not be viewed in the source. If you are hosting this code outside of Glitch, you can delete `glitch.json`.
There are three levels:

- Level One:

Uses Shell, simple to set up and use.

- Level Two

Uses PHP, a bit more advanced.

- Level Three

Uses C, a bit hard to set up, but once it is set up is it very simple to use.
