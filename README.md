HackPack
========
*"The best way to trick friends with hacks!"*
## What is HackPack?
HackPack is a starter kit to tricking your friends with "hacks" on the command line because
years of movies and TV from Hollywood have taught us that black screens with green or white text
mean **hackers!**

## Tutorials:
[Riverside Rocks Blog](https://riverside.rocks/blog/trick-friends)

## Notes: 
In this tutorial I used (friend name)/index.php because I used the PHP to write notes that could not be viewed in the source. If you are hosting this code outside of Glitch, you can delete `glitch.json`

## Advanced
Our advanced tutorial uses a .sh (shell script) file. Before you can run it, you will need to excute it.
Do this by running `chmod +x (filename).sh`. The run `./(filename).sh` to run it.
